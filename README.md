# Samwell React Assesment

This is a a simple React application, where users will be able to view a job candidate's video responses, comment on the responses & save the data.

1. How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution?

I decided to use React ,Antd and React Player as React is a modern javascript library which was created by facebook.From the start of web development there have been a question how to update the DOM efficienty?.React comes up with a solution for that which is called as Virtual Dom

One of the key benefits of React is its component-based architecture, which allows developers to create reusable UI elements and compose them to build complex applications. React also uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model), which allows it to efficiently update the UI in response to user actions or changes in the data without having to re-render the entire page.

Ant Design (Antd) is a popular UI library for React that provides a set of reusable components and design guidelines for building modern web applications. It was created by the Alibaba Group and has gained widespread adoption among developers due to its comprehensive set of components, simplicity, and ease of use.

React Player is a React-based player component for playing audio and video files, which provides a simple and customizable interface for controlling playback and displaying media content. It supports a wide range of media formats and offers various features, such as full-screen mode, playback speed control, and subtitles support.

2. Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
   Absolutely! While my submission has a responsive design, working with a UI designer could have further improved the design aspect of my application. A UI designer is a professional who specializes in designing user interfaces for software applications, websites, and other digital products. With their expertise in design principles, color theory, typography, and layout, a UI designer could have provided valuable input to ensure that the design of my application is aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly.

Furthermore, a UI designer could have helped me to create a more polished and cohesive design by ensuring consistency in visual elements such as colors, typography, and iconography throughout the application. This could have resulted in a more visually appealing and professional-looking application that users would be more likely to engage with.

In addition to improving the design aspect of my application, working with a UI designer could have also helped to enhance its mobile responsiveness. A UI designer could have ensured that the application's layout, typography, and graphics were optimized for smaller screen sizes, resulting in a more user-friendly and visually pleasing experience on mobile devices.

3. What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?

Certainly! If I were allocated more time, there are several additional improvements that I would have made to my submission. Firstly, although I have written some test cases for the API services, if I had more time, I would have aimed to unit test all the functions within the application. This would have allowed me to identify and resolve any issues with the code logic and ensure that the application functions as expected.

Furthermore, I would have invested more time in testing the application's UI using tools such as Cypress, to ensure that it works as intended across different devices and platforms.

Another area that I would have focused on is optimizing the application's performance. This could involve identifying and resolving any bottlenecks in the code, as well as optimizing the application's asset delivery and caching. By improving the application's performance, I could ensure that it loads quickly and smoothly, providing users with a seamless experience.

Overall, while I am satisfied with the current state of my submission, given more time, I believe that these improvements would have further elevated the quality of the application and provided a more satisfying experience for users.

   `cd sawell-test/`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the server: `npm start`

## Frontend

1. Clone the front-end repo: `git clone https://github.com/AhmadChaudhry628/samwell-react-assessment.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory, use the following command:
   `cd samwell-react-assessment/`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## Available Scripts for Frontend

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
